# Hi ! 
My name is Kevin Lippera and I am currently a 2nd year PhD Student in fluid mechanics and I work at LadHyX (Laboratoire d'Hydrodynamique de l'Ecole Polytechnique) under the supervision of SÃ©bastien Michelin and Michael Benzaquen. 
I mainly focus my research in low-Reynolds hydrodynamics which broaches the issue of fluid behavior at small length scales (typically micron-size).
