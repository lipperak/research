# Hi ! 
My name is Kevin Lippera and I am a 2nd year PhD Student in fluid mechanics at LadHyX (Laboratoire d'Hydrodynamique de l'Ecole Polytechnique), under the supervision of Sébastien Michelin and Michael Benzaquen. 

I mainly focus my research in small length scales hydrodynamics and especially the behavior of active particles (typically micron-size), that are good candidate as biomimetic alternatives to biological microorganism. 

Before I had plunged into the low-Reynolds fluid dynamics I graduate from the Mechanical Engeering Department of Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées (GMM) and from Aeronautical Engineering Master of sciences of Imperial College of London (AAE). 

Finally, I discovered the fascinating and exciting world of research thanks to Thierry Ondarçuhu through a project on wetting phenomenon at the nano-scale.
